# 5DayWeatherForecast

## Description

This application allows users to find the weather for "today" and for the next 5 days.
This weather application allows users to plan their every day, trips, vacations, etc. accordingly by knowing what the weather is supposed to be like and being able to prepare for it.

Building this project has helped me learn about how JavaScript works overall and how it works with API's. I have learned to use API's to fetch data and dispaly on to my website by pulling the only the information I need/want.
